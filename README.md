An app designed for students to track their daily water intake, which motivates them to reduce having caffeinated drinks to keep up with school work and focusing more on their health. 

Structure:
When the user opens the app, the first screen is a splash screen that has the name of the app, start button that directs to next screen and, the name and student number of the developer.

On the second screen the user has to enter their water intake in the morning and the afternoon. The user will be able to add notes on each day for e.g. mention other beverages or food taken on the day and if they need to work out or not.

On the last screen the user will be able to view their daily intakes and the average amount of litres drank each week.
